## Recipe App — Firebase Edition

This Android application is designed to allow users to easily create, view, edit, and delete recipes. Each recipe is stored under a specific category such as Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, or Dessert. The app connects to **Firebase Realtime Database** for cloud storage, ensuring that data can be accessed from any device, while also saving a local copy on the user’s phone using **SharedPreferences** for offline access.

When users open the app, they can navigate through three main sections — *Explore*, *Create*, and *Settings*. The **Create** screen allows users to input recipe information such as category, name, ingredients, and preparation steps. Once the “Add” button is pressed, the recipe is uploaded to Firebase and a local copy is saved for offline use. The **My List** screen enables users to view recipes by category. When a category is selected, the recipes that belong to that category are displayed. The user can then select a recipe to view its details. From there, they can choose to edit or delete the recipe. When the recipe is edited, a “Save Changes” button updates the data both in Firebase and in local storage.

The Firebase setup is straightforward. A new Firebase project should be created in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com). Once created, **Realtime Database** should be enabled with the location set to `europe-west1`. For testing purposes, database rules can be set to allow public reads and writes. After creating the database, an Android app with the package name `com.example.recipe` must be added in Firebase. This will generate a `google-services.json` configuration file, which needs to be placed inside the project’s `app` directory.

The Gradle setup is also important. In the project-level `build.gradle` file, the Firebase and Google services plugins should be included. In the app-level `build.gradle` file, the Firebase Database dependency must be added to enable communication between the Android app and the Firebase backend. The Firebase database URL for this project is
`https://recipe-c5ca1-default-rtdb.europe-west1.firebasedatabase.app/`,
and in the code, the Firebase reference should point to the `recipe/create` node as follows:

```kotlin
database = FirebaseDatabase.getInstance(
    "https://recipe-c5ca1-default-rtdb.europe-west1.firebasedatabase.app/"
).getReference("recipe/create")
```

In Firebase, recipes are organized under a parent node named `recipe`, and within it, a subnode called `create` stores each recipe entry. Each recipe entry contains a unique ID generated by Firebase, along with the recipe’s category, name, ingredients, and preparation steps. An example of the Firebase data structure looks like this:

```
recipe
 └─ create
      └─ -OaozXw-agfhcI3S1M-Y
          ├─ category: "Breakfast"
          ├─ name: "Sugar Water"
          ├─ ingredients: ["Water", "Sugar"]
          └─ steps: "Mix water with sugar until dissolved."
```

The **Create screen (`create.kt`)** manages recipe input and saving. It validates user entries and uploads them to Firebase. Once a recipe is successfully added, it displays a confirmation message and saves a backup locally. The **My List screen (`mylist.kt`)** interacts with Firebase to load categories and recipes dynamically. It allows users to select a category, view recipes within it, and make changes. The interface provides buttons for editing, deleting, and saving recipes back to Firebase. A clean, minimal layout makes it easy to navigate, with a simple bottom navigation bar for moving between Explore, Create, and Settings.

Local storage is handled through Android’s SharedPreferences. Each time a recipe is created, a JSON version of the recipe is saved to a local file named `local_recipes`. This ensures that even if the device is offline, a user can still access previously saved data.

To run the project, simply clone it from the repository, open it in Android Studio, add the downloaded `google-services.json` file to the `/app/` directory, and sync the Gradle files. Once the build is complete, the app can be run on an Android device or emulator.

This project serves as a practical example of integrating **Firebase Realtime Database** with **Android Kotlin**, demonstrating CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), real-time data synchronization, and simple data caching for offline access. It provides a solid foundation for learning how to manage structured data and user interaction in mobile applications.
